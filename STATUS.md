# Task ledger

This is the single task-status authority. Read alongside the working tree and GitHub before changes. Recovered WIP is unverified prototype code on the recovery branch, not adopted implementation. Historical reports do not certify this revision. Detailed evidence remains in docs/status.md.

## Active handoff

- Agent and UTC checkpoint: Codex-coordinator, 2026-10-26T18:45:00Z.
- Current task: P20/customer-http; branch: task/p20-customer-http; base: main; PR URL: none yet.
- Last pushed implementation commit: none for HTTP; local commits79786ce/666f4d7; uncommitted changes: contract/client and protocol tests awaiting publication.
- What works: protected create/GET/cancel/reschedule composition and explicit strict wire models; real proof/session/CSRF/transaction tests; four OpenAPI operations and regenerated typed client.
- What remains: full integrated native/coverage/hosted/Compose/exact review; public reviewed terms and all customer UI remain separate required slices. Query PR69 must merge first.
- Decisions: runtime combines customerOrder11 and administratorOrder12 with strict12-case guard. Credentials/intake remain in memory and request-only models. Generated allowedActions uses Array matching JSON; no unhydrated Set. Existing coverage thresholds and source completeness remain unchanged.
- Verification: targeted5wire/3controller/5actualPGHTTP and12runtimePG pass after Docker recovery; fresh14Angular tests/build pass with handwritten22/22lines30/30branches.14contract cases and regeneration pass. Earlier Docker interruption and contract assertion/generator mismatch remain documented failures; full current-head gates pending. PR71 confirmed merged d96e0a6 after921Java/11Angular/237Python,14hosted/Compose6/exact review.
- Next concrete action: publish draft, run all implemented categories and exact review; integrate confirmed query main before final acceptance.
- Recovery: origin/recovery/2026-10-25-prototype6f9405b and all worktrees/secrets/volumes preserved; stacked PR dependencies: PR69 and already merged PR71. No full local milestone claimed.
