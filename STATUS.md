# Task ledger

This is the single task-status authority. Read alongside the working tree and GitHub before changes. Recovered WIP is unverified prototype code on the recovery branch, not adopted implementation. Historical reports do not certify this revision. Detailed evidence remains in docs/status.md.

## Active handoff

- Agent and UTC checkpoint: Codex-coordinator, 2026-10-26T23:00:44Z.
- Current task: P24/booking-flow; branch: task/p24-booking-flow; base: main; PR URL: https://github.com/Laymer/purpuragenda/pull/83.
- Last pushed implementation commit: f463b64; uncommitted changes: email cooldown ends when verification succeeds, with a regression for immediate intake review.
- What works: real typed email issuance/redemption, memory-only fragment capture before router startup, intake validation, authoritative plaintext review/consent, immutable submission with explicit uncertain retries, and actual booking status rendering are implemented.
- What remains: independent source review, actual PostgreSQL/Mailpit browser journey, current-main full native/hosted/Compose gates. Customer management/account/admin UI remain separate slices.
- Decisions: root owns main/app routes; use generated API and shared access, no mocked backend. Capture and scrub verification fragments before router startup; keep tokens/intake in memory only. No migration or contract edits. Account/admin UI and management changes remain separate slices.
- Verification: full frontend verifier passes108Angular tests and production build; complete handwritten coverage406/409lines393/416branches, strict CSP passes. Log /private/tmp/p24-cooldown-after.log. 248strictPython, documentation and regenerated contract checks pass at the implementation checkpoint. Independent findings reproduced99tests/7failures for late private responses, cleared selection during bootstrap and wrong-path fragments; keyboard91tests/1failure and IDNA100tests/1failure separately reproduced, then all100pass. Sanitized failure counts retained. Full backend/browser checks are not yet claimed.
- Next concrete action: publish corrected implementation checkpoint, obtain fresh independent review and run isolated real browser journey, then all exact-revision gates after dependencies merge.
- Recovery: origin/recovery/2026-10-25-prototype6f9405b and every existing worktree/secret/volume retained; stacked PR dependencies:74,75,78;72 confirmed merged8702161; public selection70 confirmed merged6fc7e0a.
