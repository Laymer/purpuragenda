# Task ledger

This is the single task-status authority. Read alongside the working tree and GitHub before changes. Recovered WIP is unverified prototype code on the recovery branch, not adopted implementation. Historical reports do not certify this revision. Detailed evidence remains in docs/status.md.

## Active handoff

- Agent and UTC checkpoint: Codex-p12-shell, 2026-10-25T08:49:57Z.
- Current task: P12/angular-shell; branch: task/p12-angular-shell; base: main; PR URL: https://github.com/Laymer/purpuragenda/pull/16.
- Last pushed implementation commit: 013ae2c; uncommitted changes: final integrated evidence before publication; P48 inventory and pinned Angular receipt upload included.
- What works: contracts merged bc64f01; standing authorization04282fa; P13 merged with source-complete coverage gates.
- What remains: final exact-head CI and coordinator merge; P07 now makes real PostgreSQL verification mandatory.
- Decisions: minimal accessible home/not-found shell only; no links to unavailable product flows; all handwritten TS incl bootstrap covered90/90.
- Verification: before P07 adoption full build passed6 Angular+108domain+11security+3architecture tests; after P07 mandatory full command fails Docker startup without skips;6Angular/108domain/11security/2image tests pass and99 root Python pass; Angular22/22 lines30/30branches; contracts/31policy/live protection/secret scan passed; final scan covered145 tracked files plus full history, zero findings; suite inventory passed.
- Next concrete action: push final integrated checkpoint and require exact-head actual-container CI plus coordinator review/merge.
- Recovery: recovery/2026-10-25-prototype at6f9405b; stacked PR dependencies: P12 contract foundation merged; P43 8f5ed62 and P07 ff3b33b integrated; P48 inventory f3a4841 integrated; Angular activated as implemented jobbuild.
